# Dataify YouTube Video Post

Submit YouTube video post collection jobs through Dataify Builder and continue through final-result retrieval. This skill is a guided wrapper for six collection modes:

| Mode | Collector ID | Use For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| URL | `youtube_video-post_by-url` | Collecting video posts from a YouTube channel Videos URL. |
| Search Filters | `youtube_video-post_by-search-filters` | Searching video posts by keyword plus filters. |
| Hashtag | `youtube_video-post_by-hashtag` | Collecting video posts by hashtag. |
| Podcast URL | `youtube_video-post_by-podcast-url` | Collecting video posts from a YouTube podcast or playlist URL. |
| Keyword | `youtube_video-post_by-keyword` | Collecting video posts by keyword. |
| Explore | `youtube_video-post_by-explore` | Collecting video posts from a YouTube Explore URL. |

After submission, continue monitoring the returned `task_id` and return the final result by default.

## API TOKEN Handling

Use `DATAIFY_API_TOKEN` as the long-term saved token name.

- If `DATAIFY_API_TOKEN` is saved locally, use it.
- Do not call the Builder endpoint without a token.
- Always call it `API TOKEN` in user-facing instructions. Prefer the environment variable name `DATAIFY_API_TOKEN` for saved local use.

PowerShell examples for saving the token for the current session:

```powershell
$env:DATAIFY_API_TOKEN = "YOUR_DATAIFY_API_TOKEN"
```

For a persistent user-level variable on Windows:

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("DATAIFY_API_TOKEN", "YOUR_DATAIFY_API_TOKEN", "User")
```

## Core Workflow

1. First ask the user to choose a collection mode. Show the Mode Selection table.
2. After the user chooses a mode, show only that mode's parameter table and defaults.
3. For any dropdown-style field in the selected mode, show all allowed options as a Markdown table with `Label` and `Value` columns.
4. Ask whether the user wants to change any value before running the task.
5. Ask whether the user wants to collect multiple YouTube video post groups for the selected mode.
6. Normalize the final values into a list of parameter objects for the selected mode only.
9. Validate the selected mode, parameters, and file name.
10. Submit the Builder request with the selected mode's `spider_id`.
11. Read `data.task_id` from the Builder response and read `data.status` or `status` when present.
## Mode Selection

When the user invokes this skill, first show this Markdown table and ask them to choose one mode:

| Label | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Collect video posts by channel Videos URL | `url` |
| Collect video posts by search filters | `search_filters` |
| Collect video posts by hashtag | `hashtag` |
| Collect video posts by podcast URL | `podcast_url` |
| Collect video posts by keyword | `keyword` |
| Collect video posts by Explore URL | `explore` |

Ask: "Which collection mode do you want to use?"

Do not submit a Builder request until the mode is clear.

## Shared Parameter Handling

- `file_name` defaults to `{{TasksID}}`.
- If the user changes `file_name`, submit the user-provided value.
- `file_name` cannot be empty.
- URL-based modes must accept only URLs whose scheme and host are exactly `https://www.youtube.com`.
- Integer fields must be greater than or equal to `0`.
- Submit numeric and boolean-like values as strings, matching the Builder examples.
- Submit `spider_parameters` as a JSON string containing an array of one or more objects.

For detailed mode schemas and advanced fields, read [references/modes-and-parameters.md](references/modes-and-parameters.md) only when needed.

## Dataify Builder Request

Use form fields rather than hand-built URL-encoded strings.

- URL: `https://scraperapi.dataify.com/builder?platform=1`
- Method: `POST`
- Authorization header: `Bearer DATAIFY_API_TOKEN`
- Content type: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
- Fixed fields:
  - `spider_name=youtube.com`
  - `spider_errors=true`
- Mode-specific `spider_id`:
  - URL mode: `youtube_video-post_by-url`
  - Search Filters mode: `youtube_video-post_by-search-filters`
  - Hashtag mode: `youtube_video-post_by-hashtag`
  - Podcast URL mode: `youtube_video-post_by-podcast-url`
  - Keyword mode: `youtube_video-post_by-keyword`
  - Explore mode: `youtube_video-post_by-explore`
- Default field:
  - `file_name={{TasksID}}`
- Dynamic field:
  - `spider_parameters` must be a JSON string, not a raw object.

## Script

For stable execution, prefer `scripts/submit_dataify_youtube_video_post.py` with Python 3.6 or newer instead of rewriting the Builder flow.

```powershell
python3 ".\scripts\submit_dataify_youtube_video_post.py" --mode keyword --keyword "top videos"
```

If `python3` is not available, use the local Python 3 command for that machine, such as `python`. The script checks the runtime version and tells the user to use Python 3.6 or newer if the active interpreter is too old.

To submit multiple groups, pass a JSON array for the selected mode:

```powershell
python3 ".\scripts\submit_dataify_youtube_video_post.py" --mode hashtag --params-json '[{"hashtag":"shopping","num_of_posts":"10"},{"hashtag":"music","num_of_posts":"25"}]'
```

The script prints a JSON summary with `mode`, `spider_id`, `task_id`, `status`, `parameters`, `file_name` and `message`.

## Troubleshooting

`Missing Dataify API TOKEN` means `DATAIFY_API_TOKEN` is not set in the environment. Tell the user to get an API TOKEN from [Dataify](https://dashboard.dataify.com?utm_source=skill).

`Unsupported mode` means the mode must be `url`, `search_filters`, `hashtag`, `podcast_url`, `keyword`, or `explore`.

`URL must use https://www.youtube.com` means the URL is non-compliant.

`Unsupported order_by`, `Unsupported all_tabs`, or other unsupported dropdown messages mean the value must be one of that field's allowed values.

`File name cannot be empty` means no usable `file_name` was provided.

Missing `task_id` usually means the authorization header, token, `spider_name`, or selected `spider_id` is wrong.

## Guardrails

- Do not mix parameters from different modes in the same Builder request.
- Do not invent result fields.

## Default completion behavior

The default deliverable is the collected result, not only a `task_id`.

1. Submit the Builder task once and capture its `task_id`.
2. Immediately continue with `$dataify-task-operations` and monitor the same task ID.
   - Use the default 600-second wait for ordinary collections.
   - Use `--timeout 1800` for media downloads or clearly high-volume, multi-page, or multi-input collections.
3. When the task succeeds, download and return the final JSON result. Summarize large payloads while preserving access to the raw result.
4. If monitoring times out or is interrupted, return the task ID and a resume command. Do not resubmit the paid task.
5. Stop after submission only when the user explicitly asks for submission only, a task ID, or `--no-wait` behavior.

## Quick Start

```bash
python3 scripts/submit_dataify_youtube_video_post.py --help
```

## Parameter interaction policy

- For a clear, low-risk, read-only, and low-cost request, apply safe defaults and execute immediately. A short execution summary is optional; do not pause for confirmation.
- Ask only for a missing required input, a material ambiguity, a high-volume or multi-page scope, a media download, a choice that materially changes credit usage, an irreversible action, or an explicit user request to review parameters.
- When confirmation is required, show only user-facing values that affect the target, scope, output, or cost. Prefer one concise sentence; use a compact table only when three or more consequential values are easier to compare.
- Never show fixed fields, empty optional fields, unchanged defaults, credentials, or internal implementation parameters such as engine selectors, response-format flags, offsets, spider IDs, and file-name templates.
- Keep advanced filters hidden unless the user asks for them or they are needed to resolve ambiguity. Never substitute documentation example values for missing required user input.
- After returning results, offer relevant refinements instead of forcing all optional decisions before the first result.

## Account CTA policy

- Show a prominent Dataify account CTA only when the API token is missing, rejected/invalid, or the account has insufficient credits.
- For a missing token, offer https://dashboard.dataify.com/login?utm_source=skill and state: New accounts get 50 free credits, enough for about 6,000 trial results, valid for 7 days, and only successful requests are billed. Never ask the user to paste the token into chat.
- Detect the current operating system and shell. Show only the matching session-scoped setup command first (`export` for macOS/Linux shells, `$env:` for Windows PowerShell, or `set` for Windows Command Prompt). Show other platforms or persistent setup only when detection is ambiguous or the user asks.
- After the user says the token is configured, verify only whether `DATAIFY_API_TOKEN` is present; never print its value. If verification succeeds, continue the original task without asking the user to repeat it.
- Explain that persistent shell changes may require a new terminal or restarting the agent application. Do not recommend a project `.env` unless the execution path explicitly loads it, and ensure `.env` is ignored by version control.
- For an invalid token, direct the user to API-key management without implying that a new registration is required. For insufficient credits, direct the user to balance or recharge management.
- During normal submission, processing, and successful completion, do not promote registration or the Dashboard. Never expose the token or include it in CTA attribution parameters.
